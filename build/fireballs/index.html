      <h1>Fireballs</h1>

      <h2>What is a Fireball?</h2>
      <p>
        A fireball is another term for a very bright meteor, generally brighter
        than magnitude -4, which is about the same magnitude of the planet Venus
        in the morning or evening sky. A bolide is a special type of fireball
        which explodes in a bright terminal flash at its end, often with visible
        fragmentation.

      <h2>How frequently do fireballs occur?</h2>
      <p>
        Several thousand meteors of fireball magnitude occur in the Earth's
        atmosphere each day. The vast majority of these, however, occur over the
        oceans and uninhabited regions, and a good many are masked by daylight.
        Those that occur at night also stand little chance of being detected due
        to the relatively low numbers of persons out to notice them.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Can you see fireballs in daylight, and will a fireball leave a trail?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Yes, but the meteor must be brighter than about magnitude -6 to be
        noticed in a portion of the sky away from the sun, and must be even
        brighter when it occurs closer to the sun.<br />
        Fireballs can develop two types of trails behind them: trains and smoke
        trails. A train is a glowing trail of ionized and excited air molecules
        left behind after the passage of the meteor. Most trains last only a few
        seconds, but on rare occasions a train may last up to several minutes. A
        train of this duration can often be seen to change shape over time as it
        is blown by upper atmospheric winds. Trains generally occur very high in
        the meteoric region of the atmosphere, generally greater than 80 km (65
        miles) altitude, and are most often associated with fast meteors.
        Fireball trains are often visible at night, and very rarely by day.<br />
        The second type of trail is called a smoke trail, and is more often seen
        in daylight fireballs than at night. Generally occurring below 80 km of
        altitude, smoke trails are a non-luminous trail of particulate stripped
        away during the ablation process. These appear similar to contrails left
        behind by aircraft, and can have either a light or dark appearance.
      </p>
      <h2>Can fireballs appear in different colors?</h2>
      <p>
        Vivid colors are more often reported by fireball observers because the
        brightness is great enough to fall well within the range of human color
        vision. These must be treated with some caution, however, because of
        well-known effects associated with the persistence of vision. Reported
        colors range across the spectrum, from red to bright blue, and (rarely)
        violet. The dominant composition of a meteoroid can play an important
        part in the observed colors of a fireball, with certain elements
        displaying signature colors when vaporized. For example, sodium produces
        a bright yellow color, nickel shows as green, and magnesium as
        blue-white. The velocity of the meteor also plays an important role,
        since a higher level of kinetic energy will intensify certain colors
        compared to others. Among fainter objects, it seems to be reported that
        slow meteors are red or orange, while fast meteors frequently have a
        blue color, but for fireballs the situation seems more complex than
        that, but perhaps only because of the curiosities of color vision as
        mentioned above.

      <h2>
        Can a fireball create a sound? Will the sound occur right away, as you
        watch the fireball, or is their some delay?
      </h2>
      <p>
        There are two reported types of sounds generated by very bright
        fireballs, both of which are quite rare. These are sonic booms, and
        electrophonic sounds.<br />
        If a very bright fireball, usually greater than magnitude -8, penetrates
        to the stratosphere, below an altitude of about 50 km (30 miles), and
        explodes as a bolide, there is a chance that sonic booms may be heard on
        the ground below. This is more likely if the bolide occurs at an
        altitude angle of about 45 degrees or so for the observer, and is less
        likely if the bolide occurs overhead (although still possible) or near
        the horizon. Because sound travels quite slowly, at only about 20 km per
        minute, it will generally be 1.5 to 4 minutes after the visual explosion
        before any sonic boom can be heard. Observers who witness such
        spectacular events are encouraged to listen for a full 5 minutes after
        the fireball for potential sonic booms.<br />
        Another form of sound frequently reported with bright fireballs is
        “electrophonic” sound, which occurs coincidentally with the visible
        fireball. The reported sounds range from hissing static, to sizzling, to
        popping sounds. Often, the witness of such sounds is located near some
        metal object when the fireball occurs. Additionally, those with a large
        amount of hair seem to have a better chance of hearing these sounds.
        Electrophonic sounds have never been validated scientifically, and their
        origin is unknown. Currently, the most popular theory is the potential
        emission of VLF radio waves by the fireball, although this has yet to be
        verified.
